# 🫀 Heart Rate Analyzer using BLE and ML Integration

A smart health monitoring system that reads heart rate data from a BLE-enabled sensor (e.g., DFRobot Beetle ESP32-C3), sends it to a Node.js + MongoDB backend for real-time analysis, and optionally alerts emergency contacts via email or call when abnormal rates are detected. The system uses a dataset and ML logic for classification.
